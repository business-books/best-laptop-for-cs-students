# Best laptop for computer science students
Updated review to choose the <a href="https://qualified.one/blog/dev/best-laptop-for-computer-science-students/">best laptop for computer science students</a>.

In August, the great time begins, when you can hear “Mom, buy me a laptop!” from everywhere. This means that a new school year is about to begin. And what student in the 21st century will write a term paper by hand? Prepare an abstract in the form of a presentation with photo and video content without a PC? After reading this article, you will be able to figure out how to choose a laptop suitable for studying.

A laptop for a student is a thing without clearly defined boundaries. For some, a small leisurely netbook is more suitable, to record lectures and search for information on the Internet, while others need a standard “15th scale”, which will firmly take place on the student’s desktop, and even be able to show itself in more or less modern games.

Therefore, in this review, you will see 5 laptop models that are the best suited to take them with you every day for couples. As well as 5 heavier models, but with a large screen and performance for those who do not like to take anything with them heavier than a tablet. As usual, I will start with a little theory and try to explain as clearly as possible what you can get from a laptop for $300-$500 and what you should pay attention to first.

## Attention to detail: how to choose a laptop and not miscalculate
Obviously, if you want your newly purchased laptop to please you not only in the first minutes after the solemn extraction from the box to the applause of relatives, roommates or soulmates, then its choice must be approached carefully. Fortunately, recently about a lot of models you can find reviews on the Internet, including ours, which greatly simplifies the task. However, if you want to choose on your own, then you need to know at least some of the features so as not to be led by advertising, marketers and not always honest sellers.

As I already mentioned, you can look for a laptop for computer science students that will be in your backpack or bag every day, or you can look for a home laptop that is rarely outside the same room, but is more productive. Of course, there are both compact and productive at the same time, but their price starts from $ 1000 and quickly reaches $ 1500 or more - I will consider them in a separate article in the future. However, they all have a lot in common, so when choosing any, you can almost always use the following universal tips.

## Price
Let's start with the truth. For $300, it is impossible to get a decent laptop that will not disappoint you in anything. This is probably why the tablets managed to pull over the blanket of popularity - for $ 300 you can already buy one of the top "tablets" with an excellent display. Decent laptops, on the other hand, start to come across mostly from $ 700, and even then not very often.

## Screen
Unfortunately, a good display can only be found in laptops from $700 and not in every one. This, of course, does not mean that you can not work with a laptop with a lower cost, but you will have to put up with low resolution, low image contrast and severe distortion when you try to look at the display from an angle other than straight.

Therefore, you should pay attention to your own feelings if you got out to an electronics store, and to the manufacturer's assurances about the use of an IPS matrix if you buy a laptop over the Internet and have never seen it before. There are also good specimens among TN matrices, but you will not see this through the Internet. And vice versa - among displays with IPS there are also unimportant ones, but certainly not worse than TN, at least in the price range we have chosen. Choose the display cover to your taste, but remember that matte does not irritate with glare and reflection of everything and everything, and glossy makes the picture more attractive.

Sometimes there is frankly bad screen backlighting, as, for example, in some laptops from the ASUS N550 series. To recognize the problem while still in the store, adjust the brightness level and see if the image flickers at this stage. If you could not see it at any brightness value, then most likely there will be no problems with eye fatigue.

## Housing materials
Everything is simple here: whether you choose a laptop with an aluminum or plastic case, you still shouldn’t drop it. And special protected models are unreasonably expensive for a computer science student. The rest is already in taste and color: aluminum looks more expensive and costs more. And the cheap glossy plastic of a laptop for 20 thousand in most cases causes deep discouragement. But despondency, unlike the lack of money for food, can be experienced. Again, if there is a desire and an opportunity to look at laptops in a store, then you can see from your own experience how pleasant the case material is in your hands, whether prints easily remain on it, etc.

## Keyboard and touchpad
You will most likely not feel their suitability for long work even after a few minutes of communication with a laptop. If the keyboard flexes, don't worry.

Annoying, that's all. The adequacy of the touchpad is worth evaluating, but if anything, you can always buy a mouse. However, if you often intend to use the touchpad, then you should pay attention to its area and tactile sensations - whether it suits you. Some are irritated by ribbed surfaces, some are overly smooth.

## Processor, RAM
Since the advent of ultrabooks and the corresponding ultra-low-voltage processors from Intel, the following trend has developed: laptops are equipped with either one of these economical CPUs, and this may not be a light or compact laptop at all, or a 2-3 times more powerful processor, which is already excellent for gaming and professional laptops. There is no middle ground, generally speaking. An ultra-low-voltage CPU is easy to distinguish by the letter U at the end of the name, for example, Intel Core i5-3337 U. They should not be afraid and bypassed, like Atom family processors. On the other hand, video and image rendering using ULV processors is not as fast as we would like, so if you are studying, for example, to become a video editor, then you better look at 4-core CPUs.

In order to make it a little easier for you to navigate, we have compiled this small graph with which you can understand how much one CPU performs better than another. Of course, not all processors are collected here, but only those that have passed through our test laboratory, however, there are many current models here.

The amount of RAM also depends on the wallet and needs. In general, 4 GB is a good and most popular option today. 8 and 16 GB of "RAM" will not be superfluous when processing images and videos and similar resource-intensive processes, but with 4 "gigabytes" you can live without trouble for some time.

## Video card
With a budget of up to $800, you can't count on good settings in modern games. You can at least get acquainted with these games using a laptop costing from 30 k. Everything that is cheaper will distract you from your computer science studies much less. And, the lighter and more compact the laptop, the less likely it is to have a serious graphics card installed. Exceptions are rare and expensive.

Once again, we present a performance graph, but this time for video cards. But the most productive ones are excluded here, since you won’t find a laptop with a similar one for $800.

We also recall that, despite all the promises and slogans, the graphics built into the processor will only cope with 4K movies and old games in low resolution. Keep this in mind when purchasing a laptop without a discrete video adapter. Even a simple NVIDIA GeForce 720M will outdo a powerful "integration". However, for the minimum comfortable, in my opinion, FPS level in games, you need at least a GeForce 750M or 840M.

## Storage device
In this regard, everything remains the same as before. A hard drive means a lot of space (from 500 GB), but often a long program response and tedious OS startup. SSD - very fast system and applications, but the volume is very limited by the high price. Sometimes you can find a cheap laptop with a hybrid hard drive, or a combination of a regular HDD and a small SSD. They can cost even less than 20 thousand, but they respond faster than they can be collected for 30 k. However, this will most likely be their only plus.

## Battery, interfaces, cooling
Battery life is obviously more important for those who want to take their compact laptop with them every day to classes, sit with it during breaks in the dining room and stuff like that. In general, good models can work for 4-5 hours. In very rare cases, this parameter can reach almost 12 hours, like the Toshiba Portege Z30-A-M5S, but, unfortunately, it has disappeared from store shelves. To have a rough idea of the hypothetical autonomy of a laptop, you need to know the battery capacity. For example, 40 Wh is not enough for a 15.6-inch laptop and is normal for a 13.3-inch laptop with integrated graphics. Anything higher is better.

You don't need to worry about interfaces: in almost all cases there will be the same number of them, and they will still be too close to each other to take them all at once. Sometimes the manufacturer places the ports on the back of the laptop, which is only convenient if you rarely use them. It can also be a problem to place most of the ports on that right side. If you are right-handed, the wires on the right side of the laptop will interfere with easy mouse use.

The cooling system is one of the most important things, but it is not so easy to check its operation on the shelves. Most likely, if there are any pitfalls, then you will learn about them either in advance from our reviews, or from your own experience. There can be three problems here: a very noisy CO, strong heating of the laptop case, or, which happens less often, overheating of the processor or video card. The first two can be checked by running some demanding game, while the third one will need software that can show the temperature of the chips. It can be, for example, HWMonitor.

Better yet, use an FPS measurement program and see if the frames per second decrease during a long game from overheating or remain the same. However, it is unlikely that in the store you will be cut into tanks or something else for an hour or two in a row.

## Interesting models: light and compact
This group contains five of the most interesting, in my opinion, compact laptops in the $300 - $800 price range. The main criteria, in addition to cost, were weight and thickness - no more than 2 kg and 23 mm, respectively. The screen diagonal is 13.3-14 inches. Such a laptop is easy to take with you, it will not pull your hand away, it will not become ballast during daily trips in public transport. Also, and importantly, all 5 laptops have an SSD cache or just an SSD, which will save you nerves and patience, especially during OS and browser loading. Other characteristics already depend on the price - the higher it is, the better the screen, the more powerful the processor, and so on.

### Lenovo IdeaPad S415 Touch
This very low-budget comrade visited our editorial office and left a good impression of himself. Of course, it is largely made up of compromises inherent in entry-level laptops, but the presence of a small auxiliary SSD (only 8 GB) made the Lenovo IdeaPad S415 Touch very nimble by the standards of its class. In addition, having a 14-inch screen, the laptop weighs only 1.75 kg. But its thickness is a little too big - 23 mm. However, from my own experience I can say that it is easy and convenient to carry it with you every day in a backpack. The keyboard is great for regular typing, and the clickpad is no problem either. The capacity of the main drive is suitable for daily needs - 500 GB.

It doesn’t have a lot of processor “power”, less than modern ultrabooks, and the modification for 18,000 rubles does not have discrete video at all. Only one USB 3.0 (and two USB 2.0) and a very simple matrix with a resolution of 1366x768 pixels, low contrast and low viewing angles completes the not very happy picture. However, in terms of price / performance ratio - Lenovo IdeaPad S415 Touch is a very good help to the student.

### Lenovo IdeaPad U330p
Lenovo IdeaPad U330p, like many Lenovo laptops, has a large number of modifications. For $500, it will be equipped with a slightly more powerful processor than the previous laptop, the Intel Core i3-4010U. The display has a smaller diagonal, 13.3 inches, but also less weight and thickness - 1.53 kg and 18 mm, respectively. So carrying the Lenovo IdeaPad U330p with you is even more convenient. It also has a third more capacious battery, which will allow you to stretch longer without an outlet, with which not all classrooms of all universities are strewn.

The matrix does not shine with quality, but the overall appearance is on top - this laptop cannot be called cheap. So if you have more money, and you don’t really gravitate towards games, or you buy a laptop in addition to a desktop computer, then the Lenovo IdeaPad U330p is a very good option.

### ASUS VivoBook U38N
More “tasty” laptops start at $600, and the ASUS VivoBook U38N is one of them. About this laptop, only with an older processor, we wrote last summer. Not much has changed since then, but the ASUS VivoBook U38N still offers interesting specs. For example, it has an excellent display. It is based on an IPS-matrix, and the resolution is 1920x1080 pixels.

The second strong point is the drive, since it is an SSD - that is, work on this laptop will not be overshadowed by a long turn on and a sluggish response of programs. True, its volume is only 128 GB, so you may have to stock up on an external hard drive. Fortunately, there are three USB 3.0 ports for this. Among the minuses is the lack of a discrete graphics card, which is forgivable, given the other characteristics and low price.

### Lenovo IdeaPad Yoga 2 13
What can please a student with the second generation of the famous Lenovo Yoga transformer? In fact, the $550 modification is not very outstanding, but good in its own way. Firstly, this laptop allows you to unfold the lid of the laptop and get, albeit heavy, but powerful Windows 8 tablet. high contrast. We should not forget about the case with a soft-touch coating and a thickness of only 17.3 mm.

### ASUS Transformer Book T300LA
ASUS Transformer Book T300LA visited our office in May this year. Its distinguishing feature is the detachable keyboard. You can work with the Book T300LA like you would with a regular laptop, and take only the 13.3-inch “screen” with you to couples or cafes – after all, all the stuffing of the laptop, including the battery, is hidden in it. Thus, you will lose not only physical keys, but also 800 grams of weight.

Behind a 13.3-inch display with an IPS matrix and Full HD resolution, a 50 Wh battery fits, an Intel Core i7-4500U processor is the most powerful among the other four discussed above, as well as a full-fledged 256 GB SSD. For the sake of dividing the laptop in two, you will have to sacrifice a little compactness - together with the ASUS Transformer Book T300LA, it weighs 1.9 kg, and its thickness reaches 23 mm.
